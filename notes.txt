sendgrid api key stored in credentials.yml, 
look into ways to open that file again if needed

production and development.rb files may need tweaking based on two
different methods of attempting to configure sendgrid and action_mailer

dev or local action_mailer isn't configured properly also may need to change 
.zshrc file to have a proper path for emails(local)

mashur is getting rid on turnolinks in his application.js file but it looks 
different due to older rails version , and also the turbolinks gem
